## Project Overview

This project is a robust and scalable Event Management System designed to streamline the process of organizing, managing, and participating in various events. Built with the Laravel framework, it offers a comprehensive suite of features for both event organizers and attendees, including secure user authentication, intuitive event creation and management, and an administrative dashboard for oversight. The system aims to provide a seamless experience for managing the entire event lifecycle, from initial planning to post-event analysis.

## Motivation

This project was developed as a college project to demonstrate proficiency in web application development using the Laravel framework. The goal was to create a practical and functional event management system that could serve as a foundation for more complex applications. It addresses the common need for an organized platform to handle event creation, user participation, and administrative oversight, which are crucial functionalities in many real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure registration, login, and logout functionalities with distinct roles for regular users and administrators.
- **Event Lifecycle Management:**
  - **Creation:** Organizers can easily create new events with detailed information (title, description, date, time, location, capacity).
  - **Editing & Updates:** Flexibility to modify event details as needed.
  - **Cancellation:** Ability to cancel events with appropriate notifications.
  - **Approval/Rejection:** Administrative control over event listings, allowing for approval or rejection of submitted events.
- **User Participation:**
  - **Event Browsing:** Users can browse a list of available events.
  - **Joining/Leaving Events:** Authenticated users can join events of interest and leave if their plans change.
  - **Personalized Dashboard:** Users have a dedicated dashboard to view events they have joined or created.
- **Administrative Control:**
  - **Comprehensive Dashboard:** A powerful administrative interface for managing all aspects of the system, including user accounts, event listings, and system settings.
  - **User Management:** Tools to view, edit, and manage user profiles and roles.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their personal information and preferences.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MySQL (or equivalent)
- **Package Management:** Composer (PHP dependencies), npm (Node.js dependencies)
- **Authentication:** Laravel Breeze (for rapid scaffolding of authentication features)
- **Other Libraries:** Guzzle HTTP Client, Laravel Sanctum, Laravel Tinker

## Architecture

The Event Management System follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, inherent to the Laravel framework. This separation of concerns ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

- **Frontend:** Built with Blade templates and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend:** Powered by Laravel (PHP), handling all business logic, data processing, and API interactions.
- **Database:** MySQL (or any other compatible relational database) is used for persistent storage of event data, user information, and other system configurations.
